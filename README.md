## Goals

This project is designed to find out the skin area in the picture according to the skin color, and then make some rules to determine whether it is a pornographic picture. 

## Key steps

1. Traversing each pixel to detect whether the pixel color is the skin color.
2. The adjacent skin color pixels would be grouped into one skin region, then form several skin regions.
3. Remove skin areas with very few pixels.

## Possible features
(If time allowed)
